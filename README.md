# M1_row-and-coloumn-transposition
In the rail fence cipher, the plain-text is written downwards and diagonally on successive rails of an imaginary fence. When we reach the bottom rail, we traverse upwards moving diagonally, after reaching the top rail, the direction is changed again. Thus the alphabets of the message are written in a zig-zag manner. After each alphabet has been written, the individual rows are combined to obtain the cipher-text.  DECRYPTION  Hence, rail matrix can be constructed accordingly. Once weâ€™ve got the matrix we can figure-out the spots where texts should be placed (using the same way of moving diagonally up and down alternatively ). Then, we fill the cipher-text row wise. After filling it, we traverse the matrix in zig-zag manner to obtain the original text.
